<p>Thanks for checking out NynjaCB.</p>

<p>You should see a link/button at the bottom right of the
browser: <span style="text-decoration: underline; color:
#00f">nynjacb/span> &mdash; if you don't then you need to show the
Add-on Bar:</p>

<p>Go to <strong>View &gt; Toolbars &gt; Add-on bar</strong> to
display the bar
(or <a href="http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-on-bar-quick-access-to-add-ons">read
more here</a>).</p>

<p>Once you see the button, click it to start sharing your session.
Once you are sharing you have to tell someone else (more instructions
here) </p>
