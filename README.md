NynjaCB - Nynja Cobrowse
============================================

What is NynjaCB?
-----------------

NynjaCB is a software as a service for social collaboration with the ability to help users on the web using cobrowse features.

Using NynjaCB a user, when browsing a web page enabled with nynjacb, is able to send a code to another person which they can use to see the web page the originating user is on and provides the second user with tools to guide the user to a successful outcome.  The originating user can see the second persons mouse pointer on their screen and can see highlighted fields that the second user wishes to highlight.  

This project is a highly modified fork of the original TogetherJS modules built and no longer supported by Mozilla.
