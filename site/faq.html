            <h3>What is NynjaCB?</h3>
            <p>NynjaCB is a JavaScript library that adds collaboration features and tools to your website or app.</p>
            <h3>If I'm using NynjaCB with people, can they see the current webpage I'm on?</h3>
            <p>Yup! NynjaCB allows another user to see the content on your screen.  So just be careful and do not show sensitive information.</p>
            <h3>Does NynjaCB work on Internet Explorer?</h3>
            <p>Not really, but we really need your help to make it better on IE!  Please help us to improve NynjaCB on IE by taking on a bug in GitHub <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/nynjacb/issues?labels=IE&milestone=&page=1&state=open" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
